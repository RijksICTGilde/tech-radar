# htmx

HTMX is a lightweight JavaScript library (~14kb) that allows you to access modern browser features like AJAX, CSS transitions, WebSockets, and Server-Sent Events directly in HTML using attributes. It enables building dynamic, modern user interfaces with the simplicity of hypertext rather than complex JavaScript frameworks.

## Pros
* Minimalist approach that extends HTML's capabilities without requiring a complex JavaScript framework
* Significantly reduces the amount of JavaScript needed for interactive web applications
* Works well with server-side rendering and progressive enhancement
* Small footprint (14kb min.gz'd) with zero dependencies
* Gentle learning curve for developers already familiar with HTML

## Cons
* Less suitable for complex single-page applications with heavy client-side logic
* Limited ecosystem compared to mainstream frameworks like React or Vue
* May require more server-side processing for dynamic content
* Not as widely adopted in enterprise environments (yet)
