# Streamlit

Streamlit (https://streamlit.io/) is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science.

## Pros
*   Extremely easy to use, with a simple API.
*   Rapid development and prototyping of data science apps.
*   No front-end experience required.
*   Automatic "magic" re-rendering of the app on code changes.
*   Growing community and ecosystem.

## Cons
*   Limited customization options compared to full-fledged web frameworks.
*   Not ideal for complex, production-grade web applications.
*   Can be challenging to manage state in larger applications.
*   Debugging can be difficult due to automatic re-rendering.
*   Performance bottlenecks may occur with very large datasets or complex computations
