# Java

Java is a general-purpose, class-based programming language. It is known for its platform independence, meaning Java
code can run on any device with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed. Java is widely used for developing
enterprise applications, web applications, and mobile apps. Java is easy to learn and has a large and active community.
Overall, Java is a versatile and powerful programming language that is a great choice for a variety of software
development projects.

## Pro

* Platform Independent: Java code is known for its "write once, run anywhere" functionality. You can compile Java code into bytecode that runs on any system with a JRE, making it versatile for various environments.
* Object-Oriented: Java utilizes object-oriented programming, allowing you to create modular and reusable code components, promoting better program organization and maintainability.
* Secure: Java enforces strong memory management and has built-in security features that help prevent common coding vulnerabilities, making it a good choice for security-conscious applications.
* Large Community & Resources: With a vast and active developer community, Java boasts extensive online resources, tutorials, and libraries, making it easier to learn, find solutions, and collaborate on projects.
* Relatively Easy to Learn: Compared to some other programming languages, Java has a clear and readable syntax, making it beginner-friendly and easier to pick up, especially with its abundance of learning materials available.

## Con

* Performance: While powerful, Java programs can sometimes be slower than those written in languages like C++ due to the extra layer of interpretation by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
* Memory Usage: Java applications tend to require more memory compared to some compiled languages. This is because the JVM manages memory allocation and garbage collection, adding some overhead.
* Verbosity: Java code can be more verbose than some other languages, meaning it might take more lines of code to achieve the same functionality.
* Limited Low-Level Control: Java offers less direct control over hardware resources compared to languages like C. This can be a disadvantage for tasks requiring fine-grained control or optimizing performance for specific systems.
* Cost: While Java itself is open-source, some enterprise-level Java tools or frameworks might have licensing costs associated with them.
