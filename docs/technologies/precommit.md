# pre-commit

Pre-commit (https://pre-commit.com/) is a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks. It allows developers to define checks that run automatically before each commit, helping to catch issues early in the development process such as code style violations, missing tests, or security vulnerabilities.

## Pros
* Enforces code quality standards automatically before code reaches the repository
* Supports multiple programming languages within a single configuration
* Easy to configure and share standardized hooks across a team
* Prevents committing problematic code, reducing debugging time later
* Integrates well with CI/CD pipelines

## Cons
* Initial setup requires time and may slow down the first commit
* Can be perceived as intrusive by developers not used to having their commits checked
* May need occasional updates to maintain compatibility with evolving tools
* Some hooks can be resource-intensive and slow down the commit process
* Requires all developers to install the hooks locally for consistent enforcement
