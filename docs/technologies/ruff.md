# ruff

Ruff (https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) is an extremely fast Python linter and code formatter written in Rust. It can replace multiple Python tools like Flake8, Black, isort, pydocstyle, and others in a single package, while being significantly faster than traditional Python-based alternatives.

## Pros
* Exceptional speed (10-100x faster than Python-based linters)
* Combines functionality of multiple tools (linting, formatting, import sorting)
* Highly compatible with existing configurations from tools like Flake8
* Extensive rule set covering style, bugs, complexity, and performance
* Includes automatic fixing capabilities for many issues
 
## Cons
* Relatively new tool, still evolving with occasional breaking changes
* Not all Python linting rules have been implemented yet
* May require adjustments when migrating from established toolchains
* Documentation, while improving, isn't as comprehensive as more mature tools
* Plugin ecosystem isn't as developed as for tools like Flake8
